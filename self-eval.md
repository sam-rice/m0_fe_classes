# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

This was the most fun end-of-lesson challenge yet, for me. It felt the way I'd imagine coding a project would be; googling for new techniques, trying to de-bug by making tweaks and running code over and over again, etc. Very satisfying when you get everything to work. (even if it's not done in the most efficient way)

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I feel like I have a good balance of work-to-break time. I'm pretty attuned to when I start to struggle unproductively, I think.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

I need to work on getting more sleep. I'm a night-owl, by default, and I ran on about 5 hours of sleep every night this week, which won't be sustainable throughout the course.
